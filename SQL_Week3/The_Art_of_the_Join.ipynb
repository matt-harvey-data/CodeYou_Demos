    "**SQL JOIN clause is used to query and access data from multiple tables by establishing logical relationships between them. It can access data from multiple tables simultaneously using common key values shared across different tables. We can use SQL JOIN with multiple tables. It can also be paired with other clauses, the most popular use will be using JOIN with WHERE clause to filter data retrieval.**\n",

This results in at least one record for every row, but also a record if there is a row on the 'all side' with no match on the 'other side.'
